          <p>**Playgrounds over Paths**

Today&#39;s standard design wisdom focuses on the design of linear paths. Sometimes they may branch, but they&#39;re ultimately a sequential set of steps towards a desired outcome.

Within complex systems, these paths often lack the flexibility to adapt to emergent conditions - users acting outside the &quot;designed boundaries&quot;. 

Instead of designing explicit paths, APD is oriented towards the design of playgrounds - limited spaces where the boundaries are defined by the mechanics of the system. Within these playgrounds, desire paths will naturally form based on different factors: cost, convenience, bounded rationality, etc.

Instead of designing the &quot;center&quot; and scripting how activities within it must unfold, it designs the periphery instead, leaving the center alone. It hopes to create a free space, that can accommodate the emergent behaviors of its users.</p>

          <p>&quot;I‚Äôm challenging us to think of synesthesia as something that actually happens and to embrace a synesthetic relationship to sound and images, even though that may not be the cognitive modality that we usually inhabit. But if we do this intentionally, if we literally try to hear something that is not necessarily visualized in the image, then listening to images becomes a way of enacting the broader experience of how images register. How do we get access to those deeper resonances? For me, again, it started with the idea of thinking a concept in relationship to an object that is very different from it.&quot;</p>

          <p>It&#39;s easier to recognize beauty than it is to create it. You&#39;re good enough to know that what you&#39;re doing isn&#39;t good, but not good enough to produce something great. When you find yourself in this frustrating limbo, the challenge is to never forget what got you there in the first place. Remember that thing that got you into the game.

Your love. Your passion. Your taste. That&#39;s the reason you&#39;re here. You still belong, even if you don&#39;t feel like it right now. Your taste can be killer even if your ability is questionable.

Commit to the process and you&#39;ll become good enough, soon enough. Put in a volume of work. Close the gap.</p>

          <p>EXPERIMENTATION
The only possible way to do or make anything, ever, is by experimentation. Even a toddler‚Äôs existence is a series of experiments, mini-challenges pressed upon its environment and explored by trial-and-error. To cease to experiment is not only to cease to create in this world, but to renounce participation altogether. Non-experimentation is inert. In fact, if you are not experimenting, you might be dead. Stay as alive as possible.</p>

          <p>&quot;The process of doing research is generative. When someone gives you the answer, there are no rabbit holes, and no accidental findings. What‚Äôs fascinating to me about research is that you may have one clear question, but in the process of trying to get an answer or resolution, you stumble upon these other things‚Ä¶ and they all soon become more interesting.&quot;</p>

          <p>Human beings do not grow in perfect symmetry; they oscillate, expand, contract, back track, arrest themselves, retrogress, mobilize, atrophy in part, proceed erratically, according to experience and traumas.

Some aspects of the personality mature, others do not. Some live in the past, some in the present. Some people are futuristic characters, some are cubistic, some are hard-edged, some geometric, some abstract, some impressionistic, some surrealistic! Some of their insights remain relative and we can no longer think of a character as good or bad, but a combination of characteristics which vary according to relationship and the point in time.

We know now that we are composites in reality, collages of our fathers and mothers, of what we read, of television influences and films, of friends and associates, and we know we often play roles quite removed from our genuine selves.

          <p>*What type of ambience do you try to create?*

A quiet sense of order but without it feeling restrictive. I feel that as the world continues to fill with clutter at such a disconcerting pace, good design has the task of being quiet and helping people generate a level of calm that allows them to be themselves.

          <p>&quot;I think the reason I love making websites is the same reason I was so into architecture as a child. I would draw these elaborate floor plans of imaginary living spaces. Creating these diagrams was a form of playing for me. I‚Äôd navigate the drawings almost like a video game and imagine how each space would feel to live in.

          <p>We are committed to the idea that study is what you do with other people. It‚Äôs talking and walking around with other people, working, dancing, suffering, some irreducible convergence of all three, held under the name of speculative practice. The notion of a rehearsal‚Äîbeing in a kind of workshop, playing in a band, in a jam session, or old men sitting on a porch, or people working together in a factory‚Äîthere are these various modes of activity. The point of calling it ‚Äústudy‚Äù is to mark that the incessant and irreversible intellectuality of these activities is already present.</p>

          <p>Nobody tells this to people who are beginners, I wish someone told me. All of us who do creative work, we get into it because we have good taste. But there is this gap. For the first couple years you make stuff, it‚Äôs just not that good. It‚Äôs trying to be good, it has potential, but it‚Äôs not. But your taste, the thing that got you into the game, is still killer. And your taste is why your work disappoints you. A lot of people never get past this phase, they quit. Most people I know who do interesting, creative work went through years of this. We know our work doesn‚Äôt have this special thing that we want it to have. We all go through this. And if you are just starting out or you are still in this phase, you gotta know its normal and the most important thing you can do is do a lot of work. Put yourself on a deadline so that every week you will finish one story. It is only by going through a volume of work that you will close that gap, and your work will be as good as your ambitions. And I took longer to figure out how to do this than anyone I‚Äôve ever met. It‚Äôs gonna take awhile. It‚Äôs normal to take awhile. You‚Äôve just gotta fight your way through.

          <p>Art has to be a kind of confession. I don‚Äôt mean a true confession in the sense of that dreary magazine. The effort it seems to me, is: if you can examine and face your life, you can discover the terms with which you are connected to other lives, and they can discover them, too ‚Äî the terms with which they are connected to other people. This has happened to every one of us, I‚Äôm sure. You read something which you thought only happened to you, and you discovered it happened 100 years ago to Dostoyevsky. This is a very great liberation for the suffering, struggling person, who always thinks that they are alone. This is why art is important. Art would not be important if life were not important, and life is important. Most of us, no matter what we say, are walking in the dark, whistling in the dark. Nobody knows what is going to happen to them from one moment to the next, or how one will bear it. This is irreducible. And it‚Äôs true for everybody. Now, it is true that the nature of society is to create, among its citizens, an illusion of safety; but it is also absolutely true that the safety is always necessarily an illusion. Artists are here to disturb the peace. They have to disturb the peace. Otherwise, chaos.

          <p>**The primacy of self-discovery**
Learning happens best with emotion, challenge and the requisite support. People discover their abilities, values, passions, and responsibilities in situations that offer adventure and the unexpected. In Expeditionary Learning schools, students undertake tasks that require perseverance, fitness, craftsmanship, imagination, self-discipline, and significant achievement. A teacher&#39;s primary task is to help students overcome their fears and discover they can do more than they think they can.

**The having of wonderful ideas**
Teaching in Expeditionary Learning schools fosters curiosity about the world by creating learning situations that provide something important to think about, time to experiment, and time to make sense of what is observed.

**The responsibility for learning**
Learning is both a personal process of discovery and a social activity. Everyone learns both individually and as part of a group. Every aspect of an Expeditionary Learning school encourages both children and adults to become increasingly responsible for directing their own personal and collective learning.

**Empathy and caring**
Learning is fostered best in communities where students‚Äô and teachers‚Äô ideas are respected and where there is mutual trust. Learning groups are small in Expeditionary Learning schools, with a caring adult looking after the progress and acting as an advocate for each child. Older students mentor younger ones, and students feel physically and emotionally safe.

**Success and failure**
All students need to be successful if they are to build the confidence and capacity to take risks and meet increasingly difficult challenges. But it is also important for students to learn from their failures, to persevere when things are hard, and to learn to turn disabilities into opportunities.

**Collaboration and competition**
Individual development and group development are integrated so that the value of friendship, trust, and group action is clear. Students are encouraged to compete not against each other but with their own personal best and with rigorous standards of excellence.

**Diversity and inclusion**
Both diversity and inclusion increase the richness of ideas, creative power, problem-solving ability, and respect for others. In Expeditionary Learning schools, students investigate and value their different histories and talents, as well as those of other communities&#39; cultures. Schools&#39; learning groups are heterogeneous.

**The natural world**
A direct and respectful relationship with the natural world refreshes the human spirit and teaches[clarification needed] the important ideas of recurring cycles and cause and effect. Students learn to become stewards of the earth and of future generations.

**Solitude and reflection**
Students and teachers need time alone to explore their own thoughts, make their own connections, and create their own ideas. They also need time to exchange their reflections with others.

**Service and compassion**
We are crew, not passengers. Students and teachers are strengthened by acts of consequential service to others, and one of an Expeditionary Learning school&#39;s primary functions is to prepare students with the attitudes and skills to learn from and be of service to others.</p>

I want to learn. Everything. I have only ever wanted to learn, and to learn deeply. It&#39;s the only thing I&#39;ve ever felt good at.
But what good is knowledge not put to use? Painting, being able to apply all that I&#39;ve come to understand along with each coat of paint, and finally share so another may learn too: that&#39;s why I make art. Why I want to continue to make art, and to develop into something more than a student.   </p>

&quot;I thought of myself as like the jazz musician: someone who practices and practices and practices in order to be able to invent and to make his art look effortless and graceful. I was always conscious of the constructed aspect of the writing process, and that art appears natural and elegant only as a result of constant practice and awareness of its formal structures.&quot;</p>

          <p>&quot;I think the question behind the question is: What are we asking concepts to do? What function do concepts have in helping us to think something differently or think something more expansively? When you ask about metaphor, I hear you asking about whether these concepts are gestural allusions or whether they are being actively engaged, albeit on different terms.&quot;</p>

          <p>Website as plant

Plants can‚Äôt be rushed. They grow on their own. Your website can be the same way, as long as you pick the right soil, water it (but not too much), and provide adequate sunlight. Plant an idea seed one day and let it gradually grow.

Maybe it will flower after a couple of years. Maybe the next year it‚Äôll bear fruit, if you‚Äôre lucky. Fruit could be friends or admiration or money‚Äîsuccess comes in many forms. But don‚Äôt get too excited or set goals: that‚Äôs not the idea here. Like I said, plants can‚Äôt be rushed.</p>

Who are those catalysts that move you toward personal excellence? That relationship is necessary for everyone involved to level up.</p>
