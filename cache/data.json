People discover their abilities, values, passions, and responsibilities in situations that offer adventure and the unexpected. In Expeditionary Learning schools, students undertake tasks that require perseverance, fitness, craftsmanship, imagination, self-discipline, and significant achievement. A teacher's primary task is to help students overcome their fears and discover they can do more than they think they can.</p>\n\n<p><strong>The having of wonderful ideas</strong><br>\nTeaching in Expeditionary Learning schools fosters curiosity about the world by creating learning situations that provide something important to think about, time to experiment, and time to make sense of what is observed.</p>\n\n<p><strong>The responsibility for learning</strong><br>\nLearning is both a personal process of discovery and a social activity. Everyone learns both individually and as part of a group. Every aspect of an Expeditionary Learning school encourages both children and adults to become increasingly responsible for directing their own personal and collective learning.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Empathy and caring</strong><br>\nLearning is fostered best in communities where students’ and teachers’ ideas are respected and where there is mutual trust. Learning groups are small in Expeditionary Learning schools, with a caring adult looking after the progress and acting as an advocate for each child. Older students mentor younger ones, and students feel physically and emotionally safe.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Success and failure</strong><br>\nAll students need to be successful if they are to build the confidence and capacity to take risks and meet increasingly difficult challenges. But it is also important for students to learn from their failures, to persevere when things are hard, and to learn to turn disabilities into opportunities.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Collaboration and competition</strong><br>\nIndividual development and group development are integrated so that the value of friendship, trust, and group action is clear. Students are encouraged to compete not against each other but with their own personal best and with rigorous standards of excellence.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Diversity and inclusion</strong><br>\nBoth diversity and inclusion increase the richness of ideas, creative power, problem-solving ability, and respect for others. In Expeditionary Learning schools, students investigate and value their different histories and talents, as well as those of other communities' cultures. Schools' learning groups are heterogeneous.</p>\n\n<p><strong>The natural world</strong><br>\nA direct and respectful relationship with the natural world refreshes the human spirit and teaches[clarification needed] the important ideas of recurring cycles and cause and effect.

People discover their abilities, values, passions, and responsibilities in situations that offer adventure and the unexpected. In Expeditionary Learning schools, students undertake tasks that require perseverance, fitness, craftsmanship, imagination, self-discipline, and significant achievement. A teacher's primary task is to help students overcome their fears and discover they can do more than they think they can.\n\n**The having of wonderful ideas**\nTeaching in Expeditionary Learning schools fosters curiosity about the world by creating learning situations that provide something important to think about, time to experiment, and time to make sense of what is observed.\n\n**The responsibility for learning**\nLearning is both a personal process of discovery and a social activity. Everyone learns both individually and as part of a group. Every aspect of an Expeditionary Learning school encourages both children and adults to become increasingly responsible for directing their own personal and collective learning.\n\n**Empathy and caring**\nLearning is fostered best in communities where students’ and teachers’ ideas are respected and where there is mutual trust. Learning groups are small in Expeditionary Learning schools, with a caring adult looking after the progress and acting as an advocate for each child. Older students mentor younger ones, and students feel physically and emotionally safe.\n\n**Success and failure**\nAll students need to be successful if they are to build the confidence and capacity to take risks and meet increasingly difficult challenges. But it is also important for students to learn from their failures, to persevere when things are hard, and to learn to turn disabilities into opportunities.\n\n**Collaboration and competition**\nIndividual development and group development are integrated so that the value of friendship, trust, and group action is clear. Students are encouraged to compete not against each other but with their own personal best and with rigorous standards of excellence.\n\n**Diversity and inclusion**\nBoth diversity and inclusion increase the richness of ideas, creative power, problem-solving ability, and respect for others. In Expeditionary Learning schools, students investigate and value their different histories and talents, as well as those of other communities' cultures. Schools' learning groups are heterogeneous.\n\n**The natural world**\nA direct and respectful relationship with the natural world refreshes the human spirit and teaches[clarification needed] the important ideas of recurring cycles and cause and effect. Students learn to become stewards of the earth and of future generations.\n\n**Solitude and reflection**\nStudents and teachers need time alone to explore their own thoughts, make their own connections, and create their own ideas. They also need time to exchange their reflections with others.\n\n**Service and compassion**\nWe are crew, not passengers. Students and teachers are strengthened by acts of consequential service to others, and one of an Expeditionary Learning school's primary functions is to prepare students with the attitudes and skills to learn from and be of service to others.","description":"","source":{"url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurt_Hahn","title":"Kurt Hahn - Wikipedia","provider":{"name":null,"url":null}},"image":null,"embed":null,"attachment":null,"metadata":null,"id":1943132,"base_class":"Block","class":"Text","user":{"created_at":"2014-09-13T20:05:54.580Z","slug":"lukas-w","username":"Lukas W","first_name":"Lukas","last_name":"W","full_name":"Lukas W","avatar":"https://arena-avatars.s3.amazonaws.com/5831/small_e88b3939c2d839f5e92e81c6a6acc638.gif?1554254281","avatar_image":{"thumb":"https://arena-avatars.s3.amazonaws.com/5831/small_e88b3939c2d839f5e92e81c6a6acc638.gif?1554254281","display":"https://arena-avatars.s3.amazonaws.com/5831/medium_e88b3939c2d839f5e92e81c6a6acc638.gif?1554254281"},"channel_count":1538,"following_count":926,"profile_id":23383,"follower_count":755,"initials":"LW","can_index":false,"metadata":{"description":null},"is_premium":true,"is_lifetime_premium":false,"is_supporter":true,"is_exceeding_connections_limit":false,"is_confirmed":true,"is_pending_reconfirmation":false,"is_pending_confirmation":false,"badge":"investor","id":5831,"base_class":"User","class":"User"},"position":18,"selected":false,"connection_id":28061035,"connected_at":"2022-03-22T23:41:27.879Z","connected_by_user_id":156217,"connected_by_username":"Alice Otieno","connected_by_user_slug":"alice-otieno","category":"Founding Principals"},{"title":"A Pattern Language","updated_at":"2023-10-11T02:26:47.163Z","created_at":"2018-02-09T17:06:45.954Z","state":"available","comment_count":0,"generated_title":"A Pattern Language","content_html":"<p>When you build a thing you cannot merely build that thing in isolation, but must also repair the world around it, and within it, so that the larger world at that one place becomes more coherent, and more whole; and the thing which you make takes its place in the web of nature, as you make it.</p>","description_html":"<p>From <em>A Pattern Language</em></p>\n\n<p>By Christopher Alexander, Sara Ishikawa and Murray Silverstein (1977)</p>","visibility":"public","content":"When you build a thing you cannot merely build that thing in isolation, but must also repair the world around it, and within it, so that the larger world at that one place becomes more coherent, and more whole; and the thing which you make takes its place in the web of nature, as you make it.","description":"From *A Pattern Language*\n\nBy Christopher Alexander, Sara Ishikawa and Murray Silverstein (1977)","source":null,"image":null,"embed":null,"attachment":null,"metadata":null,"id":1734332,"base_class":"Block","class":"Text","user":{"created_at":"2012-03-19T18:50:59.452Z","slug":"laurel-schwulst","username":"Laurel Schwulst","first_name":"Laurel","last_name":"Schwulst","full_name":"Laurel Schwulst","avatar":"https://arena-avatars.s3.amazonaws.com/449/small_394b882d8af9c3ac0ae82d50d2ca27e6.png?1372882632","avatar_image":{"thumb":"https://arena-avatars.s3.amazonaws.com/449/small_394b882d8af9c3ac0ae82d50d2ca27e6.png?1372882632","display":"https://arena-avatars.s3.amazonaws.com/449/medium_394b882d8af9c3ac0ae82d50d2ca27e6.png?1372882632"},"channel_count":2180,"following_count":1881,"profile_id":1655,"follower_count":2782,"initials":"LS","can_index":false,"metadata":{"description":null},"is_premium":true,"is_lifetime_premium":true,"is_supporter":false,"is_exceeding_connections_limit":false,"is_confirmed":true,"is_pending_reconfirmation":false,"is_pending_confirmation":false,"badge":"investor","id":449,"base_class":"User","class":"User"},"position":62,"selected":false,"connection_id":34626463,"connected_at":"2022-10-14T18:25:20.579Z","connected_by_user_id":156217,"connected_by_username":"Alice Otieno","connected_by_user_slug":"alice-otieno","category":"Founding Principals"},{"title":"Dieter Rams","updated_at":"2023-10-01T22:42:10.941Z","created_at":"2016-09-25T09:43:59.631Z","state":"available","comment_count":0,"generated_title":"Dieter Rams","content_html":"<p><em>What type of ambience do you try to create?</em></p>\n\n<p>A quiet sense of order but without it feeling restrictive.
